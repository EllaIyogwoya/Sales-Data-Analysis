# RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
___
* Offering special bundles or packages including products (say macbook) with complementary products or accessories which will entice customers to purchase more can boost overall revenue for months like January with low sales.
* Create educational content such as blogs, posts, videos or FAQs that showcase advantages of owning a dryer and provide tips on how to use the right model can educate customers on any concens or misconceptions they may have about LG dryers can help increase the rate at which dryers were sold considering they were sold the least overall this time period.
* Even if AAA Battries (4-pack) is the best selling in order quantity, it generated the least revenue. We could review the pricing startegies of AAA Battries (4-pack) to enusre they are competitive in the market. 
* Gathering feedback from customers in San Fransisco (which had the highest number oforders and revenue) and Austin (which has the lowest number of orders and revenue) understand any differences in preferences or needs. Use this feedback to adjust the marketing strategies in Austin.
