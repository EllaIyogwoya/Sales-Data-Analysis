# RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
___
Here are my recommendations;
* Offering special bundles or packages including high selling products like macbook with complementary products or accessories which will entice customers to purchase more can boost overall revenue for months like January with low sales.
* Create educational content such as blogs, posts, videos or FAQs that showcase advantages of owning a dryer and provide tips on how to use the right model can educate customers on any concens or misconceptions they may have about LG dryers can help increase the rate at which dryers were sold considering they were sold the least overall this time period.
* The pricing startegies of AAA Battries (4-pack) should be review to enusre they are competitive in the market to increase revenue it generatd, considering they had the highest order volume.
* Gathering feedback from customers in San Fransisco (which had the highest number oforders and revenue) and Austin (which has the lowest number of orders and revenue) understand any differences in preferences or needs and use this feedback to adjust the marketing strategies in Austin.
